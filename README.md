These scripts reproduce the experiments described in the article:

S. Rosenzweig, H.C.M. Holme and M. Uecker: Simple Auto-Calibrated Gradient Delay Estimation From Few Spokes Using Radial Intersections (RING). arXiv-link: ---

For reconstruction we provide an adapted version of the Berkeley Advanced Reconstruction Toolbox (BART) [1]

In each folder the *.sh shell-scripts must be started. These scripts require BART [1].

The data can be viewed e.g. with 'view'[2] or be loaded into Matlab or Python using the wrappers provided in BART subdirectories './matlab' and './python'


If you need further help to run the scripts, I am happy to help you: sebastian.rosenzweig@med.uni-goettingen.de
